# Meeting Minutes Generator

This Python-based tool transforms recorded meetings into professional, impersonal minutes using AI. It first transcribes the audio and then rewrites the text according to user-defined style and formality guidelines — ideal for official records, council meetings, and other formal proceedings.

## Motivation
This project originated from a real municipal need, where accuracy, formality, and timely delivery of meeting minutes are essential. The tool aims to simplify the process by combining transcription with automated language adaptation, ensuring consistent, high-quality minutes while supporting both cloud-based and local workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- An OpenAI API key set as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required for OpenAI provider)

To install all dependencies, first create a virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marco-26/audio-transcriber.git
cd audio-transcriber/
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** You must manually install ffmpeg (e.g., `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS).

## Usage

Run the tool with:

```bash
python main.py <audio_file_path> [--provider PROVIDER] [--model_size MODEL_SIZE]
```

- `<audio_file_path>`: Path to the audio file you want to transcribe (required).
- `--provider`: Type of provider to use for transcription. Options: `OpenAI` (default), `Local`.
- `--model_size`: (For local provider) Whisper model size. Default: `tiny`.

**Example:**

```bash
python main.py data/example_audio.mp3
python main.py data/example_audio.mp3 --provider Local --model_size small
```

The transcript will be saved to a file named `transcript.txt` in the project root folder.

## Features

- Audio Splitting: Large audio files are automatically split into smaller chunks for efficient transcription.
- Transcription: Transcribes audio files using either the OpenAI API or a local Whisper model.
- Output: Saves the transcript as a text file.
- Provider Selection: Choose between OpenAI cloud or local transcription.

## Recommendations

- **Audio Compression:** Compress audio files before transcription for better performance and faster processing.
- **File Size Limitation:** Optimized for audio files up to 25 minutes. Larger files are split into chunks automatically.
